                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
                <p>My greatest achievement this year, is finishing second year with a 2:1 and achieving 3 firsts. I feel I have a lot more motivation and have learnt lots of new skills for third year. Getting 70% in my Global Current Affairs exam! But outside of that, I had the opportunity to interview Kate Nash and get my article published.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My greatest achievement this year is quite simple, I’ve completed my  degree and I’m now qualified to practice as a social worker.  I never thought I would ever be able to say something like that but I can now, and it’s something no one can ever take away from me. Being accepted as a summer undergraduate research assistant for a very exciting project has capped a really brilliant year for me. I’ll be contributing to a project – Forensic Footprints – that’s seeking to develop software to help law enforcement officers in the UK and abroad process footprints at crime scenes more easily.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have just today got back from a two week trip to Colombia with BU, we were working out there with EAFIT university. It was a great achievement as it lead to travelling alone, a big change for me, as well as achieving some awesome physical and mental goals as well as helping me develop my ideas for future careers. This year I made a resolution: to blog every day. Some days were certainly harder than others, but with this month’s page views at an all-time record (2,209 and counting) I would call it an unqualified success. And while I might not have written a book this year, in words alone my blog posts more than make up for it.</p>
